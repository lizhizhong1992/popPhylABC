Input files and R scripts to produce raw figures for our manuscript "Comparative divergence genomics enlightens a large grey zone of speciation".

Scripts for multi-pannel figures are in sub-directories.

For publication, some figures were manually reworked by using Inkscape + GIMP 

Some R scripts call functions that are in my .Rprofile. You can find it here: https://github.com/popgenomics/configFiles
